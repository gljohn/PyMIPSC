# PyMIPSC
Python Mortgage Interest/Principal Split Calculator

A quick an simple python script to calculate the N outstanding balance of a mortage and the breakdown of the payment in interest and principal. The script also generates N by using the difference between start date and analysis date. 

The general idea of this script is so I can run it as a cron job and insert the output values into ledger-cli too account from the expense and movement of principal between assets as opposed to just expensing the entire mortgage payment or having to use a csv to do this, or some other bad looking system.
